# Contributing Guidelines

The contributing guidelines are rules to follow before contributing, 
Contributing Guidelines:

1. The tests MUST succeed.
2. Do not insert dangerous code into the main OYDVAT C file
3. You cannot request to blacklist a video or channel without or with a invalid reason; we check videos/channels before blacklisting them
4. You may only edit CMakeLists.txt if you really need to
5. The tests may only be edited by me

Failing to follow the rules may lead to the issue/pull request being closed without editing the code base
